<span style="font-weight: bold;">Known Issues</span><br>
The nims processes must be started and running before starting the
web-based user interface, nims.py.&nbsp; nims.py looks for the
frame_buffer message queue which is created by the ingester
module.&nbsp; If the queue does not exist, nims.py runs but is not
connected to the sonar device.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Chrome is currently the only supported browser.<br>
<br>
The tracks are not displayed in the user interface.<br>
<br>
Tracking is not validated.<br>
<br>
The user interface shows the current parameter settings from the config
file, and the user can edit them, but there is no validation of the
user input and the configuration does not actually get changed.&nbsp;
For new parameters to take effect, the nims processes need to be
restarted and this should happen from the user interface.&nbsp; <br>
